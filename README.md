# Z-File Project â€“ Edward Figueroa

This project demonstrates Huffman Encoding-based file simulation written in C++  
for the Data Structures and Algorithms course (COP3530) at FGCU.

## Features
- Frequency analysis and Huffman Tree generation
- Binary encoding of input text
- Decompression using stored mappings
- File input/output using terminal commands

## How to Run
```bash
./FileZipper.exe zip Input.txt compressed.txt
./FileZipper.exe unzip compressed.txt output.txt
